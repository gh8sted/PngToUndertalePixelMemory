To use this tool have an PNG image in the same directory as the Index py file
You can enter the filename or number and it will only be numbers for the rest of the options
It will AUTOMATICALLY copy to your clipboard
Now that you have it copied to your clipboard go to the https://memories.undertale.com/ website on the pixel art canvas thing
And paste whatever got copied in the F12/Ctrl+Shift+I console
Refresh and voila! Your image has been converted to a lil pixel art thingy on the website, you can always edit it since it saves when you draw on it. 
(Make sure NOT to draw when you pasted it since it will overwrite it)
